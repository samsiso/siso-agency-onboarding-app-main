# Auto-Task System for Cursor

This file contains structured tasks that can be quickly copied into Cursor's prompt box for continuous development.

## How to Use

1. Copy a task block below
2. Paste into Cursor's AI prompt area
3. The AI will execute the task and suggest the next step

## Current Project Tasks

### UI Component Improvement

```
Analyze the UI components in src/components/ui/ directory. 
Find components that don't have proper TypeScript types or lack accessibility features.
Fix the most critical component and then suggest the next component to improve.
Once complete, update this task list with what was fixed and what should be addressed next.
```

### Performance Optimization

```
Profile the application performance starting with src/pages/ directory.
Identify components with unnecessary re-renders or expensive operations.
Optimize the most critical component using memo, useCallback, or other appropriate techniques.
Once complete, update this task list with what was optimized and what should be addressed next.
```

### API Integration Improvement

```
Review the API integration code in src/api/ and src/hooks/.
Find endpoints that don't have proper error handling or loading states.
Improve the most critical endpoint implementation.
Once complete, update this task list with what was fixed and what should be addressed next.
```

### Code Refactoring

```
Scan the codebase for code duplication, particularly in src/utils/ and src/components/.
Identify patterns that could be extracted into shared utilities or components.
Refactor the most significant duplication pattern.
Once complete, update this task list with what was refactored and what should be addressed next.
```

### Testing Coverage

```
Check the test coverage of our components and utils.
Identify critical components without proper tests.
Write comprehensive tests for the most important untested component.
Once complete, update this task list with what was tested and what should be tested next.
```

## Completed Tasks

### Example Completed Task

✅ Fixed TypeScript types in Button component
✅ Added proper accessibility attributes
✅ Next component to fix: Modal component
