          description: 'Comprehensive API security best practices and implementation recommendations',
          content: `# API Security Architecture Blueprint

## Executive Summary
This technical document outlines a comprehensive API security architecture for crypto platforms. It covers authentication methods, rate limiting, data encryption, and threat monitoring. The research found that implementing HMAC authentication reduces unauthorized access attempts by 82%.

## Authentication Framework
We recommend a multi-layered authentication approach:
1. **JWT with short expiration**: For session management
2. **HMAC signatures**: For request validation
3. **API key rotation**: Automatic key rotation every 30 days
4. **Scoped access tokens**: Granular permission control

## Code Example: HMAC Authentication Implementation
\`\`\`typescript
// Server-side HMAC validation
function validateHmacSignature(request, secret) {
  const timestamp = request.headers['x-timestamp'];
  const signature = request.headers['x-signature'];
  const payload = request.body;
  
  // Check timestamp freshness (prevent replay attacks)
  if (Date.now() - parseInt(timestamp) > 300000) {
    return false; // Reject requests older than 5 minutes
  }
  
  // Recreate signature
  const data = timestamp + JSON.stringify(payload);
  const expectedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(data)
    .digest('hex');
  
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(signature), 
    Buffer.from(expectedSignature)
  );
}
\`\`\`

## Rate Limiting Strategy
Implement a tiered rate limiting approach:
- **IP-based limits**: 100 req/min per IP
- **User-based limits**: 1000 req/hour per user
- **Endpoint-specific limits**: Custom limits for sensitive operations
- **Burst allowance**: Short bursts with higher limits, followed by throttling

## Data Protection
1. **TLS 1.3**: Mandatory for all API traffic
2. **Field-level encryption**: For PII and sensitive data
3. **Zero-knowledge proofs**: For certain verification operations
4. **Secure data storage**: Encrypted at rest with key rotation

## Real-time Monitoring
Implement a comprehensive monitoring system that:
- Detects anomalous request patterns
- Identifies potential DDoS attempts
- Monitors for API scanning/enumeration
- Alerts on unusual geographic access
- Tracks failed authentication attempts`,
