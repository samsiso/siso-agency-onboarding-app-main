- **Benefit-driven**: Focus on outcomes (revenue growth, client satisfaction) rather than features.
- **Transparent**: Share real numbers where possible; avoid over-hyping.
- **Conversational**: Write like you speak to a peer, not like a legal doc.
- **Inclusive & Motivational**: Encourage diverse agency sizes and backgrounds to apply.

- Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios for text & icons.
