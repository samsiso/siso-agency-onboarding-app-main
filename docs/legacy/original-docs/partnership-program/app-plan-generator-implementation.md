## 🚀 **PHASE 1 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **🎯 Goal**: Connect App Plan Generator to Partnership Program

**Timeline**: Prompts 1-2 (Current Session)  
**Deliverables**: Partnership-integrated App Plan Generator

### **1.1 Partnership Database Integration**

**Create Partner-Plan Relationship**:
```sql
-- New table to link app plans to partners
CREATE TABLE app_plans_partnership (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  partner_id UUID REFERENCES partners(id),
  client_lead_id UUID REFERENCES client_leads(id),
  business_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  industry TEXT,
  generated_content JSONB,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'draft',
  investment_range TEXT,
  timeline_estimate TEXT,
  features JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Integration Points**:
- Link plans to specific partners for commission tracking
- Connect to client leads for pipeline management
- Store business context for better AI generation

### **1.2 Partner Dashboard Integration**

**Add App Plan Generator to Partner Navigation**:
- Integrate with existing affiliate navigation structure
- Add direct access from partner dashboard
- Create partner-specific app plan management page

**Partner Context Integration**:
```typescript
interface PartnerAppPlanContext {
  partnerId: string;
  partnerName: string;
  clientLeadId?: string;
  commissionEligible: boolean;
  planOwnership: 'partner' | 'shared';
}
```

### **1.3 Business Data Pipeline**

**Connect Onboarding → App Plan Generator**:
- Fix existing `createInputFromOnboardingData()` function
- Enhance data validation and error handling
- Add business context from partner workflow

**Data Flow Enhancement**:
```
Partner Dashboard → Lead Qualification → Business Data Collection → App Plan Generation → Client Presentation → Commission Tracking
```
