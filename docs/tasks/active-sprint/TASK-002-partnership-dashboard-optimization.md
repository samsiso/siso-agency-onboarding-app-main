## üõ†Ô∏è **Implementation Guidance**

### **Suggested Approach**
1. Audit all buttons and links for functionality
2. Test dashboard on various mobile screen sizes
3. Implement responsive design improvements
4. Optimize touch targets for mobile interaction
5. Ensure proper mobile navigation patterns
6. Test all user flows on mobile devices

### **Key Considerations**
- MUST maintain dark theme with orange SISO accents
- Focus on mobile-first responsive design
- Ensure all interactive elements are easily tappable
- Consider mobile-specific UX patterns (swipe, pull-to-refresh, etc.)
- Maintain performance on slower mobile connections

### **Code Structure**
```typescript
// Expected mobile optimization patterns
interface MobileOptimizedComponentProps {
  isMobile: boolean;
  touchOptimized: boolean;
  screenSize: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'xl';
}

// Touch target specifications
const MOBILE_TOUCH_TARGET = {
  minHeight: '44px',
  minWidth: '44px',
  padding: '12px'
};
```
