## üéØ **CONTENT EXAMPLES & SAMPLES**

### **Sample Video Script: "Your First Client Conversation"**
```
[SCENE: Partner at networking event]

NARRATOR: "You're at a networking event and you meet Sarah, a small business owner. She mentions her website is outdated. Here's how a SISO partner approaches this..."

PARTNER: "That's interesting, Sarah. What's holding you back from updating it?"

SARAH: "Honestly, we got burned by a developer before. Spent ¬£3,000 and got nothing usable."

PARTNER: "I totally understand that concern. That's actually why I work with SISO - they do something different. Would you be open to seeing exactly what you'd get before you pay anything?"

[LEARNING POINT: Notice how the partner didn't immediately pitch - they asked about her concerns first...]
```

### **Sample Checklist: "Pre-Demo Preparation"**
```
‚ñ° Client's business type and size confirmed
‚ñ° Current website/system reviewed
‚ñ° Budget range discussed (not exact amount)
‚ñ° Decision maker confirmed
‚ñ° Timeline expectations set
‚ñ° App Plan Generator prepared with client details
‚ñ° Backup materials ready (case studies, testimonials)
‚ñ° Follow-up meeting scheduled in advance
‚ñ° SISO team briefed if technical questions expected
```

### **Sample Objection Response: "It's too expensive"**
```
CLIENT: "¬£1,500 seems like a lot for a website."

PARTNER RESPONSE:
1. ACKNOWLEDGE: "I understand that's a significant investment for your business."

2. REFRAME: "Let me ask you this - what's it costing you NOT to have an effective online presence? How many potential customers might you be losing each month?"

3. VALUE: "This isn't just a website - it's a 24/7 sales tool that could pay for itself with just 2-3 new customers."

4. RISK REVERSAL: "Plus, with SISO's approach, you see exactly what you're getting before you pay the full amount. There's no risk of getting burned like you mentioned happened before."

5. ALTERNATIVE: "Would it help if we looked at a smaller scope to start with? We could focus on the core functionality you need most."
