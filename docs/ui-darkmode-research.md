# UI Dark Mode Research Log

### Admin Dashboard Color Fixes - Round 1
- Updated all text and background color classes in the following files to use white or dark-mode-appropriate colors:
  - `src/components/admin/dashboard/DashboardKPI.tsx`
  - `src/components/admin/dashboard/StatsOverview.tsx`
  - `src/components/admin/dashboard/AdminTasks.tsx`
  - `src/components/admin/dashboard/ClientsList.tsx`
  - `src/components/admin/dashboard/LeadsOverview.tsx`
- Replaced `text-gray-*` with `text-white` or `text-neutral-100`.
- Ensured all backgrounds use dark-friendly colors.
- Removed any light backgrounds or dark text.

### Admin Dashboard Color Fixes - Round 2
- **Fixed Card Background Issue**: The main issue was that shadcn/ui Card components were using their default white backgrounds.
- **Updated Card Components**: Added `bg-black/30` to all Card components in:
  - `AdminTasks.tsx`
  - `ClientsList.tsx` 
  - `LeadsOverview.tsx`
  - `AdminStats.tsx`
- **Updated Remaining Text Colors**: Changed all remaining `text-gray-*` to `text-white` or `text-neutral-100` for better visibility on dark backgrounds.
- **Fixed Placeholder Text**: Updated "No clients found", "No leads found", and other placeholder text to use white color.

### Next Steps
- Visually review all admin dashboard pages for color consistency.
- Apply similar fixes to any remaining admin-related components if needed.
- Ensure all other shadcn/ui components throughout the app use dark backgrounds.
